# LemonDoodle---WangA

Notes on Getting DoodlePad Started:
  I had to make sure to put the doodlepad.jar file in the same folder as my code.
  I also had to make sure that my downloaded image was in the same folder as my code to prevent errors.
  As for setting the build commands, I learned about adding "%f" to account for all file names instead of just a Main class.
